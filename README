About
=====

The idevicerestore tool allows to restore firmware files to iOS devices. It is a full reimplementation of all granular steps which are performed during restore of a firmware to a device.

In general, upgrades and downgrades are possible, however subject to availability of SHSH blobs from Apple for signing the firmware files.

$ sudo idevicerestore -w
